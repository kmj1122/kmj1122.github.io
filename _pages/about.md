I am a PhD student at the University of Virginia, advised by Professor [Lu Feng](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lufeng/). My research focuses on developing safe and generalizable Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents.

My academic journey began in pure mathematics, with a focus on Ring Theory, a branch of commutative algebra. Back in the day, I wanted to pursue truths that would persist even beyond the end of humanity. But I came to realize that mathematics, though elegant and powerful, is also built upon axioms and it became increasingly abstract. It didn't feel like the kind of absolute truth I was searching for, even though I love describing math as the language of nature. So, I decided to focus on something useful for this era!

In my free time, I enjoy trying new recipes and napping in a dark room.
