Hey there! Iâ€™m Minjae (MJ), a PhD student at the University of Virginia, working with [Lu Feng](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lufeng/) on making AI safer and generalizable through reinforcement learning (RL). My research dives into safe RL and generalizable RL. In my free time, I enjoy trying new recipes and napping in a dark room.
